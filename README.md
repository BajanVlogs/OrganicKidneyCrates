# Sour-Crates-MCPE
My Version of the CrateKeys Plugin. About 98% working As of 7/6/2017. 
The plugin is used as a reward system for voting in most cases, though you can feel free to use in any way. 
The command /cratekey {playername} has not been completely working, i suggest using the command /give {playername} {cratekeyID}.
I did not start this from scratch, i have compiled a lot of non-working crate plugins to create this masterpiece (lol).
